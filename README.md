# Corona-hack 2020

In this time when all our events have been closed, lets create a fun event that hopefully will make some good relations across students, classes, mentros and alumni. The normal curriculum will be pushed 1 week.

## Hackathon focus
- Empowering the participants. Everyone can make a difference
- Hopefully improving everyones creativity/innovation skills
- Strengthening the cross class/cross mentor/cross alumni relationship
- Learn about something that is not code
- Have a fun relaxed event

## Schedule
- Introduction of team members + find a groupname 12:00 - 12:15
- Creativity warmup exercise maybe? Or would this take up too much time? Probably
Any ideas
- Brainstorm coming up with lots of ideas 12:15-13:00
  - Set a timer
  - Write everything down
  - Yes and. No critism
- Choose an idea 13:00 - 13:30
  - Try and score the idea on different parameters. Come up with two parameters that is relevant for your idea. Fx impact vs time to implement
- With the ideas from the brainstorm make a Idea/Problem formulation 13:30 - 14:00 
  - We want to build X for Y that solves problem Z
- Break
- Using the Idea/Problem formulation to make wireframes 14:30 - 15:00
  - Do it as simple as you can. Maybe pen and paper and then take pictures of it. Maybe shared whiteboard. 
- With the wireframes make user stories for the most important functionality 15:00 - 15:30
  - As a < type of user >, I want < some goal > so that < some reason >
  - As a user, I can indicate folders not to backup so that my backup drive isn't filled up with things I don't need saved.
- With the user stories make an MVP


## Group handin
What would be required to hand in is:
1. Idea/Problem formulation
2. At least one wireframe
3. At least one user story
4. Next steps

Homework (for the students) for that week is going to be continuing working on the project.


OR should it be a 2-5 min video explaining their idea?

Picking a winner, how? Do we make a panel?
