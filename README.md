# Corona-hack 2020

In this time when all our events have been closed, lets create a fun event that hopefully will make some good relations across students, classes, mentros and alumni. The normal curriculum will be pushed 1 week.

## Hackathon focus
- Empowering the participants. Everyone can make a difference
- Hopefully improving everyones creativity/innovation skills
- Strengthening the cross class/cross mentor/cross alumni relationship
- Learn about something that is not code
- Have a fun relaxed event

## Schedule
- **12:00 - 12:15** - Introduction of team members + find a groupname 
- Creativity warmup exercise maybe? Or would this take up too much time? Probably
Any ideas
- **12:15 - 13:00** - [Brainstorm](#brainstorm)
- **13:00 - 13:30** - [Idea selection](#idea-selection)
- **13:30 - 14:00** - [Idea formulation](#idea-formulation)
- **14:00 - 14:30** - Break
- **14:30 - 15:00** - [Wireframes](#wireframes)
- **15:00 - 15:30** - [User stories](#user-stories)
- **15:30 - 16:00** - [MVP](#mvp-minimal-viable-product)


### Brainstorm
Come up with lots of ideas!
  - Set a timer
  - Write everything down
  - Yes and. No critism

### Idea selection
Try and score the idea on different parameters. Come up with two parameters that is relevant for your idea. Fx impact vs time to implement

### Idea formulation
With the idea that you selected, make an idea formulation describing the idea.

Please include both these types of descriptions
  - We want to build X for Y that solves problem Z
  - Write a short description of the idea (about 10 lines or more) that describes these things:
    - What problem/problems are you solving?
    - Who are the users?
    - What exactly should the app do?

### Wireframes
Using the Idea/Problem formulation to make wireframes 
  - Do it as simple as you can! Maybe pen and paper and then take pictures of it. Maybe shared whiteboard, you decide. 

### User stories
- With the wireframes make user stories for the most important functionality 
  - As a < type of user >, I want < some goal > so that < some reason >
  - As a user, I can indicate folders not to backup so that my backup drive isn't filled up with things I don't need saved.

### MVP - Minimal Viable Product
With the user stories make an MVP

## Group handin
What would be required to hand in is:
1. Idea/Problem formulation
2. At least one wireframe
3. At least one user story
4. Next steps

Homework (for the students) for that week is going to be continuing working on the project.


OR should it be a 2-5 min video explaining their idea?

Picking a winner, how? Do we make a panel?
