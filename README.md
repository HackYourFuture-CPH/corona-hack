# Corona-hack 2020

In this time when all our events have been closed, lets have a fun event that hopefully will make some good relations across students, classes, mentros and alumni

The hackathon will be focused not on developing an app, but on coming up with an idea and further develop this idea. If you find time to develop something that is awesome, but it is absolutely not expected!! 

The mentors and the alumni that has joined is going to be a part of the groups just like everyone else. There will be no one functioning as "mentors" in the groups! But Benjamin, Marie and Daniel will work as facilitators. That means if you have any questions reach out to us! 

The groups can be [found here](groups.md). If someone is missing a group it is a mistake and please reach out.

The normal curriculum will be pushed 1 week


## Schedule
The schedule is approximate times. It should used as a rough guide of how to progress through the day :) 

Try and use your time as well as you can. Fx while some are working on the idea formulation, maybe it makes sense that someone is working on the wireframes or user stories

- **12:00 - 12:15** - Hackathon introduction - We will post webex link
- **12:15 - 12:30** - [Introduction of team members](#introduction-of-team-members) + find a groupname
- **12:30 - 13:00** - [Brainstorm](#brainstorm)
- **13:00 - 13:30** - [Idea selection](#idea-selection)
- **13:30 - 14:00** - [Idea formulation](#idea-formulation)
- **14:00 - 14:30** - Break
- **14:30 - 15:00** - [Wireframes](#wireframes)
- **15:00 - 15:30** - [User stories](#user-stories)
- **15:30 - 16:00** - [MVP](#mvp-minimal-viable-product)

### So what is my homework? 
The homework is to finish the [group handin](#group-handin). If you are already done with that on the Sunday, then continue working on the idea! Maybe adding user stories, improving the wireframes, implementing some functionality, its up to you!

### Introduction of team members
Make a joined call with everyone from the group. You could do that just using the slack call functionality or you could set up a call in webex/zoom/whatever you as a group agree on

One by one introduce yourself. After that see if you can find a groupname. 

### Brainstorm
Come up with lots of ideas!
  - Use the 30 min but not more!
  - Write everything down. Fx in a google docs document
  - When someone if coming up with an idea there should be no critisism. Instead try and build on top of ideas others have.
    - Instead of saying no, say yes and...

### Idea selection
Come up with two parameters that is relevant for your idea. That could be fx impact vs time to implement.

Now draw the two parameters on a xy axis. Plot the different ideas from your brainstorming session on the graph. Use this tool to help you choose the idea!

### Idea formulation
With the idea that you selected, make an idea formulation describing the idea.

Please include both these types of descriptions
  - We want to build X for Y that solves problem Z
  - Write a short description of the idea (about 10 lines or more) that describes these things:
    - What problem/problems are you solving?
    - Who are the users?
    - What exactly should the app do?

### Wireframes
Using the Idea/Problem formulation to make wireframes 
  - Do it as simple as you can! Maybe pen and paper and then take pictures of it. Maybe shared whiteboard, you decide. 

### User stories
- With the wireframes make user stories for the most important functionality 
  - As a < type of user >, I want < some goal > so that < some reason >
  - As a user, I can indicate folders not to backup so that my backup drive isn't filled up with things I don't need saved.

### MVP - Minimal Viable Product
With the user stories make an MVP

## Group handin
What would be required to hand in is:
1. Idea formulation

## Picking a winner
We will make a panel that will pick the best idea based on these goals
